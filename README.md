This project was created for navigation on the first floor of the main building of Ivan Franko Lviv National University. 


Unfortunately, we were not able to implement our original idea, which was to use the IMU to track the user's position.
The main problems were:
Inaccuracy of sensor data received by the phone. This deprived us of the ability to implement user tracking in the simplest way.

The second problem was the lack of professional knowledge to filter, process and correct real data using mathematical formulas or algorithms.

The list of scientific articles that were learned for the implementation of navigation using IMU will be attached in a separate folder in this repository.
